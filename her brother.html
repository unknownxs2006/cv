<p><em>The thing is that short people always have sharp brain and in shorty's case we can compare him to mouse. The reason i compared him with mouse is because of his teeth and back to the main point in pitu's case its obvious to have sharp brain because he's soo short <strong>He is very talented indeed</strong></em></p>
